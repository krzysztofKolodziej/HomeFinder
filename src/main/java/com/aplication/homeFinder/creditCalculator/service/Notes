Formula for the maximum loan amount
P =  (EMI * ((1+r)^2 - 1)) / (r * (1 + r)^2

EMI (Equated Monthly Installment),
P - loan amount
r - monthly interest rate
n - number of payments (number of months)

Formula for the mortgage payment
R=K*(1+(b/m)^n)*(1+(b/m)-1)/[(1+(b/m)^n)-1]

R – payment amount
K – loan amount
b – annual interest rate
m – number of months in a year
n – number of installments
